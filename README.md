# Data Visualizer

- Live Site URL: [Data Visualizer](jessejputnam.github.io/data-visualizer)

## Summary:

- This was a small project to begin exploring data visualization with D3.js. Given a set of data, I wanted to create a pop-up modal that showed the important information prominently, and secondary information in a graphical way.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all available data choices
- Be able to click an opportunity and view the associated information in a pop-up card
- Display in a generally aesthetic fashion
- Use D3.js to display data-over-time line graph
- Use D3.js to display interactive chart nesting even more data
- Close the modal
- Move laterally along the array of data with buttons
